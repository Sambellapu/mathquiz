Programme to test basic math skills

Yash, Shubham, and Rishi are three friends and they want to know who is good at mathematics among them. For this, they
want to make a competition to declare the winner. Rishi wants to create a python program for the competition. The
program should generate ten random questions like 123+456, 754-34, etc. Then it should ask the user to enter the correct
answer and also calculate the time taken for each answer. At the end, it should show an overall score out of 10 and the
time taken by the user to answer all the questions. Create such a program to help Rishi and also check who is good at
calculations among his friends.
